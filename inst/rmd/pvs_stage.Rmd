# 1. Voting process for the identification of best genotypes `r stage`

A group of farmers, men and women, and other stakeholders are gathered and, after explanation of the overall objectives of the trial, they are asked to identify their three personal favorite genotypes. Then, they are requested to vote by giving:

- Three votes for the best genotype.
- Two votes for the second.
- One vote for the third.

Votes are recorded for men and women.

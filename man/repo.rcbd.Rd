\arguments{
\item{traits}{The traits to analize.}

\item{geno}{The genotypes.}

\item{rep}{The replications.}

\item{dfr}{The name of the data frame.}

\item{maxp}{Maximum allowed proportion of missing values to estimate, default is 10\%.}

\item{title}{Report title.}

\item{subtitle}{Report subtitle.}

\item{author}{Report author.}

\item{format}{The output file format for the report, \code{"html"} by default.
Other options are \code{"word"} and \code{"pdf"}.}

\item{server}{Logical. If \code{"FALSE"} works with local machines.
Otherwise works in server environments.}

\item{server_dir_name}{If \code{"server = TRUE"}, this is the directory name in the server.}

\item{server_file_name}{If \code{"server = TRUE"}, this is the file name in the server.}
}
\value{
It returns an explanation about the RCBD fitted model.
}
\description{
Produces an automatic report for selected traits in an experiment with a RCBD.
}
\details{
It fits a linear model for a RCBD and explains the results.

Under the assumption of fixed effects an ANOVA table is computed with missing values
estimated up to a specified percentage (10\% by default). If the ANOVA results in
a significant value for genotypes then the Tukey HSD method for pairwise differences
is applied. Assumptions of the model are evaluated with residual plots.

Under the assumption of random effects the model is estimated using REML and the
variance components are shown. Missing values are not estimated in this case.

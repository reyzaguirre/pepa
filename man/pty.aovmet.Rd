\description{
Explain a fitted model for a multi environment trial (MET) with a RCBD
in each environment in plain English.
}
\details{
It fits a linear model for a MET with a RCBD and explains the results.
If data is unbalanced, missing values are estimated up to an specified maximum
proportion, 10\% by default. Genotypes and environments are considered as fixed
factors while the blocks are considered as random and nested into the environments.

\arguments{
\item{vars}{The variables to analize.}

\item{trt}{The treatments.}

\item{env}{The environments.}

\item{rep}{The replications.}

\item{dfr}{The name of the data frame containing the data.}

\item{maxp}{Maximum allowed proportion of missing values to estimate, default is 10\%.}

\item{title}{Report title.}

\item{subtitle}{Report subtitle.}

\item{author}{Report author.}

\item{format}{The output file format for the report, \code{"html"} by default.
Other options are \code{"word"} and \code{"pdf"}.}

\item{server}{Logical. If \code{"FALSE"} works with local machines.
Otherwise works in server environments.}

\item{server_dir_name}{If \code{"server = TRUE"}, this is the directory name in the server.}

\item{server_file_name}{If \code{"server = TRUE"}, this is the file name in the server.}
}
\value{
It returns an automatic report about the MET with a RCBD fitted model.
}
\description{
Produces an automatic report for selected variables in a multi environment
trial (MET) with a RCBD in each environment.
}
\details{
It fits a linear model for a MET with a RCBD for the selected variables.
If data is unbalanced, missing values are estimated up to an specified maximum
proportion, 10\% by default. Treatments and environments are considered as fixed
factors while the blocks are considered as random and nested into the environments
for ANOVA.
